From a engineering perspective, ROSIA is a challenging product platform. Unlike single-purpose apps, our ROSIA product platform is composed of multiple single purpose apps that are used by distribution partners of our customers. The apps work together and seamlessly with cloud based backend apps to automate and enhance processes to drive sales, visibility and distribution efficiency. Our product roadmap is filled with interesting challenges that expand the boundaries of our platform.

We're looking for fearless engineers who understand the difference between solving complex problems and writing highly maintainable code in a team setting, and can happily excel at both. 

Evolve is being built upon a commitment to providing the best possible experience for the end user, even if it requires going to great lengths in engineering and design effort. While we love rapid iteration where it makes sense, we also take the time and effort to make farsighted architectural and infrastructural design decisions and place emphasis on performance, code quality over speed in delivery.

We believe in the power of highly motivated and capable individuals to accomplish great things in small teams, with end-to-end ownership of projects and rapid iteration. Every day offers a variety of work, an opportunity to contribute new ideas, and the ability to share your knowledge.
